Installation
1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/realtime-qna-app.git
cd realtime-qna-app
2. Directory Structure
Ensure your project directory has the following structure:

realtime-qna-app/
├── backend/
│   ├── app.py
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── ... (other backend files)
├── frontend/
│   ├── lib/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   │   └── api_service.dart
│   │   └── ... (other Flutter code)
│   ├── pubspec.yaml
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── ... (other frontend files)
├── mongo-init.js
├── docker-compose.yml
└── README.md
Running the Application
Using Docker and Docker Compose
This is the recommended method for running the application, as it simplifies the setup process by containerizing all components.

1. Build and Start the Services
From the root directory of the project, run:

bash
docker-compose up --build
This command builds the Docker images and starts all the services defined in docker-compose.yml.

2. Access the Application
Frontend: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost.

Backend: The backend API can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.

3. Verify the Services
To list all running containers:

bash
docker ps
To view the logs of all services:

bash
docker-compose logs -f
Running Without Docker
If you prefer to run the application without Docker, follow these steps.

Backend Setup
Install Python 3.12 or higher.

Create a Virtual Environment:

bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
Activate the Virtual Environment:

Windows:

bash
venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux:

bash
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask App:

bash
python app.py
Ensure that the Flask app is running on http://0.0.0.0:5000.

Frontend Setup
Install Flutter SDK: Follow the instructions on Flutter's official website to install the Flutter SDK.

Navigate to the Frontend Directory:

bash
cd frontend
Get Flutter Dependencies:

bash
flutter pub get
Update API Base URL:

In lib/services/api_service.dart, set the baseUrl to point to the backend URL:

dart
// lib/services/api_service.dart
class ApiService {
  static String baseUrl = 'http://localhost:5000';
  // ... rest of the code
}
Run the Flutter App:

For web:

bash
flutter run -d chrome
For mobile emulator or physical device:

bash
flutter run
